prompt 1: 
I am tasked with creating a livestream and timelapse device that captures images and video for 2 years. I am seeking your help and to go back and forth on the design. 
I've listed out most of the technolgies used. I would like you to go over it and provide some solutions. I want to keep the system design elegant so I want to use python  
to manage ffmpeg stream and images. I don't know what libraries to use to store the timelapse photos on my AWS s3 bucket and I'm unfamilar with AWS. Please ask me questions and 
help me work through a design before we start coding. Thank you.
